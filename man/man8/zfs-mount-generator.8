zfs\-mount\-generator \- generates systemd mount units for zfs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /lib/systemd/system-generators/zfs\-mount\-generator
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
The zfs\-mount\-generator implements the \fBGenerators Specification\fP
of
.BR systemd (1),
and is called during early boot to generate
.BR systemd.mount (5)
units for automatically mounted datasets. Mount ordering and dependencies
are created for all tracked pools (see below). If a dataset has
.BR canmount=on
and
.BR mountpoint
set, the
.BR auto
mount option will be set, and a dependency for
.BR local-fs.target
on the mount will be created.

Because zfs pools may not be available very early in the boot process,
information on ZFS mountpoints must be stored separately. The output
of the command
